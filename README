This program is a tool which accepts hexadecimal values representing MIPS instructions
on stdin and produce some information about these instructions on stdout. 

The output is formatted in such a way that it can be piped to tools such as grep , sort , etc. 
This program will also accept command line arguments that will adjust the type of information that 
is printed to stdout. 

When given the command line flag -i the program will produce simple statistics in the following
format. Each line will contain the instruction type, the count of this instruction type given in the input, and
the percentage of this instruction type (based on the total number of instructions provided in the input).

When given the command line flag -r the program should list out the statistics of each register. There is
a column for how many times it was used in total, how many R-type instructions used it, how many I-type
instructions used it, how many J-type instructions used it, and the percentage of times the register was 
being used based on all the other registers.

When given the command line flag -o the program should list out the statistics of each opcode used.
There are 64 (2^6) different opcodes. This program also tracks the number of times an opcode is used and
the percentage used in the entire program. 

For the instructions with opcode 0x00 , also known as R-type
instructions, the function field is additionally used to specify the instruction. The function field is 6-bits,
enabling 64 (2^6) additional instructions. This program also keeps track of the function field and its usage
percentage with respect to the total number of instructions with opcode 0x00.
